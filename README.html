    <h1>CreateSimulator README:</h1>
    <p>The CreateSimulator is intended to provide a simple editing and testing environment for
      iRobot's Create educational platform, in particular for the Command Module that can plug
      into the back.</p>
    <p>It will provide three methods for testing code:<ol><li>Direct compilation and
      downloading to the Command Module for running code on the embedded system.</li><li>
      Indirectly running code on the Create (or any serial-equipped iRobot device compatible
      with their Open Interface v2) via a serial cable.</li><li>Simulated execution on a
      host computer in a virtual testing environment.</li></ol></p>
