    <h1>CreateSimulator README:</h1>
    <p>The CreateSimulator is intended to provide a simple editing and testing environment for
      iRobot's Create educational platform, in particular for the Command Module that can plug
      into the back.</p>
    <p>It will provide three methods for testing code:<ol><li>Direct compilation and
      downloading to the Command Module for running code on the embedded system.</li><li>
      Indirectly running code on the Create (or any serial-equipped iRobot device compatible
      with their Open Interface v2) via a serial cable.</li><li>Simulated execution on a
      host computer in a virtual testing environment.</li></ol></p>
    <h2>System Requirements:</h2>
    <p>Aside from the usual Java 6.0 or better, compiling code with this system requires further
      tools not included with this software:<ul><li>For Linux operating systems:<ul><li>To
        compile for local execution, you'll need GCC version 4.2 or later</li><li>For compiling
        code to run on the Command Module, you'll need GCC-AVR 4.3 or later, AVR-DUDE version 5.8
        or later, and AVR-LIBC version 1.6 or later.</li></ul></li><li>Other OSes are not yet
        directly supported.</li></ul>
