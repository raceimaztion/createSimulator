		<h1>Create Simulator - Simulation Interface</h1>
		<p>The simulation interface needs a few additional commands not included in iRobot's
				Open Interface v3, the communication protocol used by their Roomba and Create
				devices. For this reason, we have added a few extra commands that are
				intercepted by the repeater interface and translated so they will actually
				work, or at least partially work the way intended.</p>
		<p>The additional commands are listed as follows:
			<ul><li><tt>PowerOn</tt>: As the code running on the Command Module is allowed to
						turn the robot on and off, the code running locally must be able to
						turn the virtual robot on and off, as well as at least checking the
						power state of the robot over the serial cable. This command tells the
						robot to power on.</li>
				<li><tt>PowerOff</tt>: Tells the robot (virtual or real) to power off.</li>
				<li><tt>RobotIsOn</tt>: A virtual sensor command that asks if the robot is
						powered on. Returns 0x01 if the robot is actually on or 0x00 if it
						is not.</li>
			</ul></p>
